## Description
This project aims to solve the "Minimum Operations" problem. The goal is to implement an algorithm in Python to find the minimum number of operations required to reach a target value from a given initial value. The operations allowed are:
1. Increment the current value by 1.
2. Double the current value.

## Instructions
To use the provided solution, execute the Python script `min_operations.py`. You can adjust the `initial_value` and `target_value` variables inside the script to test different scenarios.

## Example
```python
python min_operations.py
