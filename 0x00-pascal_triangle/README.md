# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Algorithm

This project implements Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The rows of Pascal's Triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row 0 at the top (the 0th row). Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Implemented By
